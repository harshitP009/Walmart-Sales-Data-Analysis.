Approach Used

1.Data Wrangling

During this initial phase, the data is examined to detect any NULL or missing values, and strategies for data replacement are implemented to address and substitute these values effectively.

Build a database
Create a table and insert the data.
Select columns with null values in them. Null values are not present in our database because, in creating the tables, NOT NULL was specified for each field, effectively filtering out any null values

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducting exploratory data analysis is essential to address the project's listed questions and objectives.
